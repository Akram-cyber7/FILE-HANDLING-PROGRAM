## DESCRIPTION OF TASK 1

 Task 1 – File Handling in C (CODTECH Internship)
 Objective:
The purpose of Task 1 was to understand and implement basic file handling operations in the C programming language. File handling is one of the most important concepts in C when working with data that needs to be saved or loaded from files instead of memory. This task helped me learn how to create a file, write data into it, read its contents, and append additional data—all using file I/O functions in C.

What I Learned:
Through this task, I explored how to use standard file handling functions like:

fopen() – to open or create a file

fputs() and fgetc() – to write and read characters

fclose() – to close the file after use

I also learned about different file modes:

"w" – write mode (creates or clears file)

"r" – read mode

"a" – append mode (adds data at the end)

These modes help us control how we want to interact with the file.

About the Program:
The program is fully interactive. It begins by asking the user to enter a file name (e.g., data.txt). Then, it displays a menu with the following options:

Create a File – This option creates a new file using the name provided by the user.

Write to File – It allows the user to input data and saves it to the file. If the file already contains something, it will be overwritten.

Read File – This reads and prints the contents of the file on the screen, line by line.

Append to File – Adds new data to the end of the existing content, without deleting anything.

Exit – Ends the program.

Each function is written separately to keep the program organized and easy to understand. The functions are named in a simple way like makeFile, writeToFile, readFromFile, and addToFile, so it’s beginner-friendly and readable.

 How to Run:
Save the file as file_task1.c

Compile using:
gcc file_task1.c -o file_task1

Run it using:
./file_task1

Enter any file name like notes.txt and start exploring file operations through the menu.

 Output:
The output is menu-based and shows clear prompts for each operation. You can write text to the file and then read or append more text. The contents are saved in a file in the same folder as the code.

 Conclusion:
This task gave me a strong understanding of how to manage data with files in C. File handling is very useful when dealing with permanent storage, and now I know how to use it in real projects. I also practiced working with input/output functions and got more comfortable with strings and file pointers in C.

This task is part of the CODTECH internship, and the code has been tested and works perfectly. All functions are well-commented, so anyone can understand and modify the code easily
